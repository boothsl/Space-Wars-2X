// Laser Shot C# Script (version: 1.02)
// SPACE UNITY - Space Scene Construction Kit
// http://www.spaceunity.com
// (c) 2013 Stefan Persson

// DESCRIPTION:
// Laser shot script for demo purposes. Moves the transform with a velocity and
// uses raycast to check for hit and spawn impact effect. It also randomly destroys
// objects it hits. The reason for randomness is just to allow impact effect and you
// would most likely want to implement a "hit points" script for targets where you
// can deduct hitpoints on impact until it is destroyed rather than using the random
// demo function in this script.

// This has been updated to support network multiplayer:
// - If this is not the server, then this is no raycasting.
// - If this is the server, then network then need to let the game controller know of
//   the hit so it can properly handle it.
// The game controller should implement IGameHitCounter and assign it to the
// property "GameHitController".

// INSTRUCTIONS:
// This script is attached to the LaserShot prefab for demo purposes.

// Version History
// 1.02 - Prefixed with SU_LaserShot to avoid naming conflicts.
//        Added documentation.
// 1.01 - Initial Release.
