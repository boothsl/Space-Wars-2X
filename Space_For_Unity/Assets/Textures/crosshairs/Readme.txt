Description: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Well after a night of hard work, I'm glad to bring you this pack of
    Crosshairs that can be used in Red Eclipse. All the crosshairs were
    created from scratch using mainly Paint.NET (http://www.getpaint.net/).

    I need to acknowledge that some of the crosshairs are NOT exactly centered
    around the axis, this is because I was short on time & it was hard to
    center the crosshair on a 256x256 pixels image. But this is no problem
    because the crosshair gets scaled to "0.05" by default, so normally you
    would not even notice it.

    Any other problems, send me your feedback.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Contents: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The Crosshairs are classified in sub-directories according to their shape:
      *   circle:  for circular Quake style crosshairs.
      *    cross:  for common cross & plus like crosshairs.
      *   simple:  for simple dots & lines like crosshairs.
      *   square:  for square & romboid like crosshairs.
      * triangle:  for triangle & triad like crosshairs.

    In each subdirectory are 4 different files for a particular Crosshair:
      * crosshair-XX.pdn       - Paint.NET project file.
      * crosshair-XX.png       - Normal Crosshair.
      * crosshair-XX-hit.png   - Hit Crosshair (blends over the Normal one).
      * crosshair-XX-whole.png - How the Crosshair actually looks.

    Where: <crosshair> is a name and <XX> is a number, i.e. circle-01.png

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 How to use: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    You need to input the commands manually, because Red Eclipes doesn't have
    a menu (yet) to change the crosshairs. An example:

        /crosshairtex "crosshairs/circle/circle-01"
        /hitcrosshairtex "crosshairs/circle/circle-01-hit"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       TODO: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    * Write a script that changes the crosshairs?
